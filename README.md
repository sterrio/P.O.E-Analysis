# Path of Exile Analysis
A repository to test a small python project of getting data from a .csv file and returning different facts and statistics.
Inspired by a dataset found on kraggle, which you can see [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/gagazet/path-of-exile-league-statistic) 

# Objectives 

#### My current goals with the dataset.
* A total number of players in each division, usage of each class in descending order.
* Predict chance to be at top 30 in each division, if we are a Necromancer. With and without stream.
* Show dependency between level and class of died characters. Only for HC divisions.

# Results

- To be continually updated..

The amount of players in each in division are as follows..

* Harbinger - 14,918
* Harbinger Hardcore - 14,905
* SSF Harbinger - 14,981
* SSF Harbinger Hardcore - 14,972

This is interesting as I thought the game would have a casual stronger player base than a hardcore one, though as you can see from the data, there is almost the exact same amount of players in the hardcore mode as there is in the normal mode.
